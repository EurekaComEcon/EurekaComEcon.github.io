            The field I want to devote my work into, is the combination where
            AI and Social Science meets. I hope one day in future which is not
            that far, we could achieve a more fair, civil and inovative 
            society based on the power of the combination of AI and Economic 
            Theories, which in traditional way, we could never have.
            People deverse a better world.
